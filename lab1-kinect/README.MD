### Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
If you are building your application based on the C# samples, most of them use WPF for drawing on the screen. WPF's API is quite involved and doing basic operations such as reusing a drawing or drawing several points might be time consuming for the developer and cpu-intensive. The links below introduce basic concepts as well as some more advanced ones:
